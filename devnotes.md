# frontend framework

- ingest rates
- map visualization
  - live notifications showing up on map
- customers management
- offer management
- offer report

# overview page

Idea is to make it a kind of walk through with steps. Ideally, each step has some kind of interaction combined with a basic visualization.

Schema -> render list of tables along with status icon
Pipelines -> render number of cities, number of pipelines, and ingest throughput
Segmentation -> show some kind of viz linking subscribers to segments
Matching -> sample notifications generated

# Reminders

- Check TODOs
- configure pipeline size?
- configure database partitions?
